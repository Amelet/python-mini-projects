# Python mini projects

*Project #1: Automation with Selenium*<br>
Use Selenium to test a submission form on a website

*Project #2: PassChecker*<br>
Test your password using https://haveibeenpwned.com if it has ever been compromised.<br>
The algorithm accepts a list of passwords given in the list_to_check.txt. If several passwords are given, they should be separated by comma.<br>
To check each password, the algorithm will:
1. Hash each password using sha1;
2. Get first five characters of hashed password;
3. Send a request to api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{first 5 hash characters} to check if first five characters of the password match with compromised passwords;
4. Retrieve the list of compromised passwords that start with the same five characters;
5. On the computer where python is run, the algorithm compares remaining characters of a being checked password with the retrieved ones;
6. The algorithm returns counts how many times the password is found in the data set.


*Project 3: Web scraper*<br>
Scraping https://news.ycombinator.com/ website to retrieve links to the news that have >99 votes. The algorithm checks first three pages of the website.


*Project 4: Check pass validity (length and used characters) + unittest of the code*<br>
Passwords should be >= 8 characters long, a-z, A-Z, 0-9, #%$@, and end with a number
